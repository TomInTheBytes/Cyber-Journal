# AnyFix Technique
This page is a deep dive into the variants of *Fix threats (e.g. ClickFix, FileFix, and PromptFix). This is a procedure for technique [T1204.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/004/).

## Threat Intelligence
ClickFix emerged in late 2023 as a technique abusing fake error or CAPTCHA dialogs to trick users into pasting malicious code. Initially seen in cybercrime campaigns, it quickly spread to state-sponsored groups through 2024. Attackers leverage trusted interfaces like run dialogs, terminals, and file Explorer paths for execution. Variants evolved into FileFix and PromptFix, with different attack sequences. By 2025 it has become a common cross-platform delivery method for stealers, RATs, ransomware, and custom malware.

## Attack Simulation
We simulate parts of the attack to generate logs for further analysis. There are various options available:

### Atomic Red Team
The [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) project develops small and highly portable detection tests. They have created a [special test](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1204.002/T1204.002.md#atomic-test-12---clickfix-campaign---abuse-runmru-to-launch-mshta-via-powershell) for Clickfix as well, where Powershell is used to insert a payload as value for the RunMRU registry key. This simulation focuses on what makes this technique unique only and ignores any other traces a typical attack might leave behind. 

***Atomic Red Team: T1204.002 Test #12 - ClickFix Campaign - Abuse RunMRU to Launch mshta via PowerShell:*** *Simulates a ClickFix-style campaign by adding a malicious entry to the RunMRU registry key that launches mshta.exe with a remote payload:*

``` ps1
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RunMRU" -Name "atomictest" -Value '"C:\Windows\System32\mshta.exe" http://localhost/hello6.hta'
```

### Simulated Phishing Page
For a more realistic simulation, a static simulation webpage can be crafted and hosted within the lab for interaction using the victim machine. 

TBD

!!! info "Custom ClickFix run dialog payload"
    Simulates a user pasting a potentially malicious Powershell command into the Windows run dialog, following a typical ClickFix structure to deceive users.

    ``` ps1
    powershell Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://www.cloudflare.com" -Method GET  # âœ… I am not a robot - Verification ID: 123456 - Press OK
    ```


## Logs
TBD

<!-- what do we see with ClickFix
- Command execution (Elastic agent, Symon, Powershell)
- DNS request (Symon)
- Registry RunMRU value set (Sysmon)

TODO
- Powershell logs detection
- toml -->


## Detection & Hunting

Elastic has published a [detection](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/behavior/rules/windows/execution_suspicious_command_shell_execution_via_windows_run.toml) rule for the Elastic Security for Endpoint product. This contains an EQL query that can be adapted to create a detection rule in Kibana, see query below. Lines contain annotations at the beginning to understand the logic used. Note that some elements of the original EQL were removed because of unpopulated fields in Kibana (fields related to threads).

TBD

``` sql linenums="1" title="[EQL] [Elastic Defend + Symon] Suspicious command shell execution via Windows run"
/* (1)! */ process where (event.action == "start" or event.action == "Process creation") and
/* (2)! */ process.name : ("cmd.exe", "powershell.exe", "curl.exe", "msiexec.exe", "mshta.exe", "wscript.exe", "cscript.exe") and
/* (3)! */ process.parent.name : "explorer.exe" and 
/* (4)! */ process.args_count >= 2 and
/* (5)! */ not (process.name : "cmd.exe" and process.args : ("*.bat*", "*.cmd", "dir", "ipconfig", "C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sconfig.cmd ", "Code\\bin\\code.cmd ")) and

```

1. **Event action filter:** Only include process creation events (Elastic Defend and Symon respectively).
2. **Process name filter:** Include high-risk or commonly abused executables.
3. **Parent process filter:** Restrict to processes launched by Explorer (user-initiated).
4. **Argument count filter:** Only include processes with two or more arguments, indicating significant execution.
5. **cmd.exe exclusion**: Filters out typical command prompt scripts and administrative commands.
6. **powershell.exe exclusion**: Filters normal PowerShell scripts and self-elevating commands.
7. **msiexec.exe exclusion**: Ignores standard MSI installer executions.
8. **specific command lines exclusion**: Excludes known safe system commands.
9. **wscript/cscript exclusion**: Ignores standard Windows Script Host scripts such as network drive mapping.

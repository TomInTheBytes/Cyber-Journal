# SANS Holiday Hack Challenge
The SANS training institute organizes an annual CTF during the winter holiday season. It is free of charge and played in form of an online multiplayer rpg-like game including a world to walk around freely where you can meet your peers, NPCs with dialogue, and a storyline, making it a unique CTF.

I have completed this CTF on multiple occassions. For some of them, I have created a write-up.

- **2022**: completed but no writeup available.
- **2024**: [complete write-up](https://tominthebytes.github.io/SANS-HHC-2024/). My submission was [selected](https://www.sans.org/cyber-ranges/holiday-hack-challenge/winners-and-answers) as 'super-honorable mention' by SANS.
